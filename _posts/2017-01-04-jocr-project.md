The client had a website of the medical journal and they wanted to build mobile apps that are compatible with their website. I worked with them to build the iOS and Android application from scratch.

These apps were built using as hybrid apps leveraging the modern web technologies. The apps were primarily built using the Ionic Framework and AngularJS as the programming language. 

The benefit of the hybrid approach helped the client to launch both the apps rapidly into the market. Having apps for both the platforms encouraged the client to market the apps to doctors without having to worry about the mobile platform they (doctors) were using. This, in turn, boosted the number of users significantly. 

There was a deep search integrated into the app, so the doctor (user) can search for any article, issue, journal, etc. from a single search text box. This resulted in ease of use for the doctors and benefited the client with increased interactivity from the users.

Doctors were also given the facility to download any article they liked, which was stored in a local cache. This helped the doctors who are on the go to read the articles they wanted without having to worry about network connectivity.

I also helped the client setup the Apple as well as Google developer account and worked with them to publish the app onto the Appstore and Playstore.
