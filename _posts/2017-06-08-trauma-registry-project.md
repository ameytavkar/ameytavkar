#### Apple Appstore Link - [Trauma Registry App](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/trauma-registry/id1150440354?mt=8)
<hr />

The client wanted to build a mobile based registry for their client's medical society. This app is specifically targeted towards surgeons who are always on the go but want to collate data for their society's research.

I worked with them to build an offline first mobile app which enabled the surgeons to enter data regardless of the network availability. Behind the scenes, there was a synchronization engine built to work seamlessly with local realm database and the server. This synchronization engine took care of uploading and download any records that were created on the app or on the server. It would also sync the records, even if the app was in the background, so the surgeons would not have to do clerical work of always opening the app and syncing the records.

There is a deep search functionality integrated into the app, so the surgeon can type in any keyword and the app will display the matching results in form of a list.

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) was another interesting feature that was required in the app. As the app is heavy on the data entry part, to ease the clerical job of entering the data, the surgeon could use the OCR functionality to scan the documents and the data would be prefilled in the required fields. This functionality reduced their data entry time to a great extent.

Development-wise an open source OCR engine called [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/) was used. This engine is written in C++ and was integrated into our Swift code.

I helped the client setup the Apple developer account and worked with them to publish the app onto the Appstore. In the process, we also made the app IPv6 compliant as this is one of the major requirements for an app to be submitted to the Appstore.
