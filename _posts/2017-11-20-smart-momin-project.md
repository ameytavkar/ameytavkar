The client wanted to have a simple app for their community to post various jobs, events, etc information. The Android app was already developed and iOS app was needed to on par with the Android app. I helped them build the app in a very short amout of time which enabled them to showcase the app in their respective event. 

The app relies on Realm Database for storing all the offline data and uses a custom synchronization engine to sync the textual as well as binary data to the server. Source code is completely written in Swift 4 and the app is compatible from iOS 9 onwards.
