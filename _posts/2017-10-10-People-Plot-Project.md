![Cover](http://localhost:4000/assets/images/people-plot-cover.jpg)

The client had developed an algorithm and wanted to develop an iOS app around it. The app is primarily a contact manager but with a twist. Instead of scheduling meetings, the app can inteligently come up with suggestions for scheduling meetings.

I designed the UI/UX of the app for them and also developed the app.

The codebase is written in Swift 4 and Realm is used to store the offline data. 

The app is not yet published in the app store, but is released as beta in testflight.
