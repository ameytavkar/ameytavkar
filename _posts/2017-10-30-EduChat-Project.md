The client is a startup in Education field. The app is primarily a chat application for students and professors. There are a lot of value added features inside the app such as "Bot chat", "Anonymous chat", "Comments within the chat", etc.

Basic version of the app was built in Swift 3 and one of my major task was to convert the code base from Swift 3 to Swift 4. I also had to fix critical issues in implementation of Socket.IO, and real time notifications. 

Most of my work in this project was related to UI. I implemented a lot of custom UI controls to respect the design of the app.

I also helped the client in brainstorming new ideas and implemented one of them. The app is not live on app store yet, its still in beta testing phase.
